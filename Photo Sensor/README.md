# Photo Sensor README

In this project, my main goal was to light up an LED if the Photo Sensor senses a light source - such as sunlight, ambient indoor light or flashlight from your phone. LED will be turned off if the photocell is covered by darkness. In the code I'll need to establish a threshold value for the amount of light that needs to be exposed for the LED to turn on.

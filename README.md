# Arduino_Projects
Welcome y'all to my Arduino Repository! 

Here I will be recording my learnings and experiences using Arduino. Ranging from beginner friendly projects to more advanced projects; with the purpose to inspire and encourage others in thwir interest with Arduino. Regarding future plans, I look to develop more complex Arduino projects integrating a variety of technologies, such IoT and machince learning. Hint hint, thats a tease for an upcoming project I'll be sharing with the rest of you soon. 

The inclusion of Wiring Schema for each project will be added soon! :)

Special thank you to Professor Douglas Gilbert for providing me with an Arduino kit during my first semeseter of senior year and allowing me to keep past graduation.

# Arduino_Projects
Welcome y'all to my Arduino Repository! 

Here I will be logging my learnings and experiences with using Arduino. Ranging from beginner friendly projects to more advanced projects. Regarding future plans, I look develop more complex Arduino projects integrating a variety of technologies, such IoT and machince learning. Hint hint, thats a tease for an upcoming project I'll be sharing with the rest of you soon.

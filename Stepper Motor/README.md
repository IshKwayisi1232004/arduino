# Stepper Motor README

In this project, I designed a stepper motor to complete 1 revolution in one direction, then wait 1 second and complete another revolution in the opposiste direction. Under the condition that the algorithm loops indefinetly.

This small exercise is meant to teach the basics of a stepper motor. Reinforcing the stepper motor's ability to rotate in precise, discrete steps. The features of the motor allow for it to conduct accurate positioning and speed control without the concern for complex feedback to the motor.
